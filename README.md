# Guitar Hero to Guitar Hero II Deluxe
Guitar Hero songs ported to Guitar Hero II Deluxe with bass charts and practice sections*.<br>

*NOTE: Only songs from Guitar Hero Redux, Guitar Hero II Deluxe, and custom charts have bass and practice sections.

*NOTE 2: Any song that just says "jnack's port" was ported with AddyMills script from [MidiTools/GH1toGH2](https://github.com/AddyMills/MidiTools/blob/main/GH1toGH2/GH1_to_GH2.py)

*NOTE 3: "Custom chart" does not imply the guitar is recharted. rather, it means a custom bass chart was added.*
