# Onyx 3D graphics configuration

# Notes on spatial orientation.
# We use OpenGL-style (right-handed) space:
#   X is left (-) right (+)
#   Y is down (-) up (+)
#   Z is forward (-) backward (+)
# The highway is flat, parallel to the Z axis,
# where future events come from the negative Z direction.
# The camera is positioned above the track,
# pointed at an angle towards that negative Z direction, then slightly down.
